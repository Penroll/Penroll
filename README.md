## Hello! 

My name is Seamus, and I'm a computer science student at NC State. 

I am proficient in Java and Swift/SwiftUI, and am learning currently learning Kotlin & Jetpack Compose for Android. I have experience in Python, HTML & CSS, Javacript and AngularJS, as well as Java's Spring and Hibernate frameworks. I'm mostly interested in backend development and mobile development.
