## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Seamus, and I'm a Computer Science student full time at university. I mainly code in Java, but I have some Python experience and I'm looking into JavaScript/CSS for making websites. 

### Advent of Code

I tried some of [Advent of Code](https://github.com/Penroll/Advent-Of-Code-2020) while I still had free time during the holidays, although I didn't get very far. I have only recently tried adding more to my github after I began college, and the enterprise github account was something that I have been using a lot.
